sm-misc
===========================

[![Build status](http://ci.splewis.net/job/sm-misc/badge/icon)](http://ci.splewis.net/job/sm-misc/)

This is a collection of various, mostly unrelated, sourcemod plugins. Most are for CS:GO. Some may be labelled as for CS:GO, but work more generally.

## Requirements

Sourcemod 1.7 or later. Plugins are currently intended to be compiled using the 1.7.2 compiler

## Downloads

You may find some compiled versions of the plugins at http://dl.whiffcity.com/plugins/sm-misc. The only file you need to downloads is the `.smx` file.

There are also [continuous builds](http://ci.splewis.net/job/sm-misc/lastSuccessfulBuild/) available for the plugins. These will be more recent than the plugin versions at http://dl.whiffcity.com/plugins/sm-misc.

## Installations

Installation instructions vary by plugin. For most, you only need to move the plugin binary (the .smx file) into ``addons/sourcemod/plugins`` and you will be good to go. Some plugins may have cvars, and some might create a config file to set those cvars when the plugin first starts. Generally, those will be in ``cfg/sourcemod/<plugin_name>.cfg``.

## Plugin descriptions

TODO.

For now, you can can find some descriptions in the [source code](https://github.com/splewis/sm-misc/scripting) for the plugins, in the description field.
